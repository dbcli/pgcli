  ``wider_completion_menu`` option available. If not add it in and set it to
  ``True``.

* Completion menu now has metadata information such as schema, table, column, view, etc., next to the suggestions. (Thanks: `Darik Gamble`_)
* Customizable history file location via config file. (Thanks: `Çağatay Yüksel`_)

  Add this line to your config file (~/.pgclirc) to customize where to store the history file.

::

  history_file = /path/to/history/file

0.18.0
======

Features:
---------

* Add fuzzy matching for the table names and column names.

  Matching very long table/column names are now easier with fuzzy matching. The
  fuzzy match works like the fuzzy open in SublimeText or Vim's Ctrl-P plugin.

  eg: Typing ``djmv`` will match `django_migration_views` since it is able to
  match parts of the input to the full table name.

* Change the timing information to seconds.

  The ``Command Time`` and ``Format Time`` are now displayed in seconds instead
  of a unitless number displayed in scientific notation.

* Support for named queries (favorite queries). (Thanks: `Brett Atoms`_)

  Frequently typed queries can now be saved and recalled using a name using
  newly added special commands (``\n[+]``, ``\ns``, ``\nd``).

  eg:

::

    # Save a query
    pgcli> \ns simple select * from foo
    saved

    # List all saved queries
    pgcli> \n+

    # Execute a saved query
    pgcli> \n simple

    # Delete a saved query
    pgcli> \nd simple

* Pasting queries into the pgcli repl is orders of magnitude faster. (Thanks: `Jonathan Slenders`_)

* Add support for PGPASSWORD environment variable to pass the password for the
  postgres database. (Thanks: `Irina Truong`_)

* Add the ability to manually refresh autocompletions by typing ``\#`` or
  ``\refresh``. This is useful if the database was updated by an external means
  and you'd like to refresh the auto-completions to pick up the new change.

Bug Fixes:
----------

* Fix an error when running ``\d table_name`` when running on a table with rules. (Thanks: `Ali Kargın`_)

  partially typed word. Now completions will match even if the partially typed
  word is in the middle of a suggestion.
  eg: When you type 'mig', 'django_migrations' will be suggested.
* Completion for built-in tables and temporary tables are suggested after entering a prefix of ``pg_``. (Thanks: `Darik Gamble`_)
* Add place holder doc strings for special commands that are planned for implementation. (Thanks: `Irina Truong`_)
* Updated version of prompt_toolkit, now matching braces are highlighted. (Thanks: `Jonathan Slenders`_)

* Add special command ``\dT`` to show datatypes. (Thanks: `Darik Gamble`_)
* Add auto-completion support for datatypes in CREATE, SELECT etc. (Thanks: `Darik Gamble`_)

  'CREATE DATABASE blah WITH TEMPLATE <tab>'. (Thanks: `Daniel Rocco`_)
* Add custom decoders to json/jsonb to emulate the behavior of psql. This
  removes the unicode prefix (eg: u'Éowyn') in the output. (Thanks: `Daniel Rocco`_)
* Add \df special command to show functions. (Thanks: `Darik Gamble`_)
* Make suggestions for special commands smarter. eg: \dn - only suggests schemas. (Thanks: `Darik Gamble`_)
