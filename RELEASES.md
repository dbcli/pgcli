Releasing pgcli
---------------

You have been made the maintainer of `pgcli`? Congratulations!

To release a new version of the package, [create a new release](https://github.com/dbcli/pgcli/releases) in Github. This will trigger a Github action which will run all the tests, build the wheel and upload it to PyPI.
