CHANGELOG
=========

1.0.8: 2016-10-16
-----------------

Fixes:
- In 'shortcuts': complete_while_typing was a SimpleFilter, not a CLIFilter.
- Always reset color attributes after rendering.
- Handle bug in Windows when '$TERM' is not defined.
- Ignore errors when calling tcgetattr/tcsetattr.
  (This handles the "Inappropriate ioctl for device" crash in some scenarios.)
- Fix for Windows. Correctly recognize all Chinese and Lithuanian characters.

New features:
- Added shift+left/up/down/right keys.
- Small performance optimization in the renderer.
- Small optimization in the posix event loop. Don't call time.time() if we
  don't have an inputhook. (Less syscalls.)
- Turned the _max_postpone_until argument of call_from_executor into a float.
  (As returned by `time.time`.) This will do less system calls. It's
  backwards-incompatible, but this is still a private API, used only by pymux.)
- Added Shift-I/A commands in Vi block selection mode for inserting text at the
  beginning of each line of the block.
- Refactoring of the 'selectors' module for the posix event loop. (Reuse the
  same selector object in one loop, don't recreate it for each select.)


1.0.7: 2016-08-21
-----------------

Fixes:
- Bugfix in completion. When calculating the common completion to be inserted,
  the new completions were calculated wrong.
- On Windows, avoid extra vertical scrolling if the cursor is already on screen.

New features:
- Support negative arguments for next/previous word ending/beginning.


1.0.6: 2016-08-15
-----------------

Fixes:
- Go to the start of the line in Vi nagivation mode, when 'j' or 'k' have been
  pressed to navigate to a new history entry.
- Don't crash when pasting text that contains \r\n characters. (This could
  happen in iTerm2.)
- Python 2.6 compatibility fix.
- Allow pressing <esc> before each -ve argument.
- Better support for conversion from #ffffff values to ANSI colors in
  Vt100_Output.
    * Prefer colors with some saturation, instead of gray colors, if the given
      color was not gray.
    * Prefer a different foreground and background color if they were
      originally not the same. (This avoids concealing text.)

New features:
- Improved ANSI color support.
    * If the $PROMPT_TOOLKIT_ANSI_COLORS_ONLY environment variable has been
      set, use the 16 ANSI colors only.
    * Take an `ansi_colors_only` parameter in `Vt100_Output` and
      `shortcuts.create_output`.


1.0.5: 2016-08-04
-----------------

Fixes:
- Critical fix for running on Windows. The gevent work-around in the inputhook
  caused 'An operation was attempted on something that is not a socket'.


1.0.4: 2016-08-03
-----------------

Fixes:
- Key binding fixes:
      * Improved handling of repeat arguments in Emacs mode. Pressing sequences
        like 'esc---123' do now work (like GNU Readline):
              - repetition of the minus sign is ignored.
              - No esc prefix is required for each digit.
      * Fix in ControlX-ControlX binding.
      * Fix in bracketed paste.
      * Pressing Control-U at the start of the line now deletes the newline.
      * Pressing Control-K at the end of the line, deletes the newline after
        the cursor.
      * Support negative argument for Control-K
      * Fixed cash when left/right were pressed with a negative argument. (In
        Emacs mode.)
      * Fix in ControlUp/ControlDown key bindings.
      * Distinguish backspace from Control-H. They are not the same.
      * Delete in front of the cursor when a negative argument has been given
        to backspace.
      * Handle arrow keys correctly in emacs-term.
- Performance optimizations:
      * Performance optimization in Registry.
      * Several performance optimization in filters.
      * Import asyncio inline (only if required).
- Use the best possible selector in the event loop. This fixes bugs in
  situations where we have too many open file descriptors.
- Fix UI freeze when gevent monkey patch has been applied.
- Fix segmentation fault in Alpine Linux. (Regarding the use of ioctl.)
- Use the correct colors on Windows. (When the foreground/background colors
  have been modified.)
- Display a better error message when running in Idle.
- Additional flags for vt100 inputs: disable flow control.
- Also patch stderr in CommandLineInterface.patch_stdout_context.

New features:
- Allow users to enter Vi digraphs in reverse order.
- Improved autocompletion behaviour. See IPython issue #9658.
- Added a 'clear' function in the shortcuts module.

For future compatibility:
- `Keys.Enter` has been added. This is the key that should be bound for
  handling the enter key.

  Right now, prompt_toolkit translates \r into \n during the handling of the
  input; this is not correct and makes it impossible to distinguish between
  ControlJ and ControlM. Some applications bind ControlJ for custom handling of
  the enter key, because this equals \n. However, in a future version we will
  stop replacing \r by \n and at that point, the enter key will be ControlM. 
  So better is to use `Keys.Enter`, which becomes an alias for whatever the
  enter key translates into.


1.0.3: 2016-06-20
-----------------

Fixes:
- Bugfix for Python2 in readline-like completion.
- Bugfix in readline-like completion visualisation.

New features:
- Added `erase_when_done` parameter to the `Aplication` class.  (This was
  required for the bug fixes.)
- Added (experimental) `CommandLineInterface.run_application_generator` method.
  (Also required for the bug fix.)

1.0.2: 2016-06-16
-----------------

Fixes:
- Don't select the first completion when `complete_while_typing` is False.
  (Restore the old behaviour.)


1.0.1: 2016-06-15
-----------------

Fixes:
- Bugfix in GrammarValidator and SentenceValidator.
- Don't leave the alternate screen on resize events.
- Use errors=surrogateescape, in order to handle mouse events in some
  terminals.
- Ignore key presses in _InterfaceEventLoopCallbacks.feed_key when the CLI is in the done state.
- Bugfix in get_common_complete_suffix. Don't return any suffix when there are
  completions that change whatever is before the cursor.
- Bugfix for Win32/Python2: use unicode literals: This crashed arrow navigation
  on Windows.
- Bugfix in InputProcessor: handling of more complex key bindings.
- Fix: don't apply completions, if there is only one completion which doesn't
  have any effect.
- Fix: correctly handle prompts starting with a newline in
  prompt_toolkit.shortcuts.
- Fix: thread safety in autocomplete code.
- Improve styling for matching brackets. (Allow individual styling for the
  bracket under the cursor and the other.)
- Fix in ShowLeadingWhiteSpaceProcessor/ShowTrailingWhiteSpaceProcessor: take
  output encoding into account. (The signature had to change a little for
  this.)
- Bug fix in key bindings: only activate Emacs system/open-in-editor bindings
  if editing_mode is emacs.
- Added write_binary parameter to Vt100_Output. This fixes a bug in some cases
  where we expect it to write non-encoded strings.
- Fix key bindings for Vi mode registers.

New features (**):
- Added shortcuts.confirm/create_confirm_application function.
- Emulate bracketed paste on Windows. (When the input stream contains multiple
  key presses among which a newline and at least one other character, consider
  this a paste event, and handle as bracketed paste on Unix.
- Added key handler for displaying completions, just like readline does.
- Implemented Vi guu,gUU,g~~ key bindings.
- Implemented Vi 'gJ' key binding.
- Implemented Vi ab,ib,aB,iB text objects.
- Support for ZeroWidthEscape tokens in prompt and token lists. Used to support
  final shell integration.
- Fix: Make document.text/cursor_position/selection read-only. (Changing these
  would break the caching causing bigger issues.)
- Using pytest for unit tests.
- Allow key bindings to have Keys.Any at any possible position. (Not just the
  end.) This made it significantly easier to write the named register Vi
  bindings, resulting in an approved start-up time.)
- Better feedback when entering multi-key key bindings in insert mode. (E.g.
  when 'jj' would be mapped to escape.)
- Small improvement in key processor: allow key bindings to generate new key
  presses.
- Handle ControlUp and ControlDown by default: move to the previous/next record
  in the history.
- Accept 'char'/'get_char' parameters in FillControl.
- Added refresh_interval method to prompt() function.

Performance improvements:
- Improve the performance of test_callable_args: this should significantly
  increase the start-up time.
- Start-up time for creating the Vi bindings has been improved significantly.

(**) Some small backwards-compatible features were allowed for this minor
     release. After evaluating the impact/risk/work involved we concluded that
     we could ship these in a minor release.


1.0.0: 2016-05-05
-----------------

Fixes:
- Adjust minimum completion menu width to match UIControl and Window class.
- Bugfix regarding weakref in InputProcessor.
- Fix for pypy3: bug in WeakValueDictionary.
- Correctly handle '0' key binding in Vi mode.
- Also load Vi bindings by default in Application if no registry has been given.
- Only go into selection mode if the current buffer is not empty.
- Close PipeInput after usage.
- Only use 16 colors in (Emacs) eterm-color.
- Bugfix in "xP Vi key binding.
- Bugfix in Vi { and } key binding.
- Fix: use correct token for Scrollbar in MultiColumnCompletionMenuControl.
- Handle negative values in translate_row_col_to_index.
- Handle decomposed unicode characters.
- Fixed Window.always_hide_cursor. (Parameter was ignored.)
- Fix in zz Vi key binding. (When render info is not available.)
- Fix in Document.get_cursor_up_position. (When an argument is given.)

New features:
- Separated `load_mouse_bindings`.
- Refactoring/simplification of the key bindings: better use of filters and
  CLI.editing_mode.
- Added DummyOutput class and a few unit tests that test the whole CLI.
- Use the bisect module in Document._line_start_indexes instead of a custom
  binary search. This should improve the performance.
- Stay in the same column when doing multiple up/down movements.
- Visual improvements:
  * Implemented cursorcolumn, cursorline and colorcolumn.
  * Only reserve menu space when `complete_while_typing=True` or when there are
    completions to be displayed.
  * Support for chaining tokens for combined styles. SelectedText will now
    reverse the colors from the highlighting by default. Style
    `Token.SelectedText` to set a fixed foreground/background.
    Also for SearchMatch, we now use combined tokens.
  * Support for dark gray on Windows.
  * Default token for SystemToolbar and SearchToolbar.
  * Display selection also on empty lines.
- Emacs key bindings improved:
  * Recognize + handle ControlDelete key.
  * Implemented meta-* and control-backslash key bindings.
- Vi key bindings improved:
  * Handle inclusive and linewise motions properly.
  * Fix g_ motion off by one character, and don't work when cursor is in
    the trailing whitespace part of line.
  * Make a(/a)/i(/i)/... motions. Find enclosing brackets instead of the next
    bracket.
  * Update N% motion according to vim behaviors.
  * Fix | motion off by one character.
  * ge/gE motions go to end of previous word, not start.
  * Added Vi 'gm' key binding.
  * Implemented 'gq' key binding in Vi mode. (Reshape text.)
  * Vi operator/text object separation for key bindings.
  * Added 'ap' (auto-paragraph) text object.
  * Implemented Vi digraphs. ControlK will now insert a digraph.
  * Implemented vi tilde_operator.
  * Support named registers.
  * Vi < and > key bindings became operators.
  * Text objects and motions are now separate bindings.
  * Improved copy/paste in Vi mode.

Backwards-incompatible changes:
- Don't reset the current buffer anymore by default in
  CommandLineInterface.run(). Passing `reset_current_buffer=True` is now
  required.
- Renamed MouseEventTypes to MouseEventType for consistency. The old name is
  still valid, but deprecated.
- Refactoring of Callbacks. All events should now receive one argument, which
  is the sender. (Furter, Callback was renamed to Event.) This is mostly used
  internally.
- Moved on_invalidate callback from CommandLineInterface to Application
- Renamed `PipeInput.send` to `PipeInput.send_text`. (Old deprecated name is
  still kept as a valid alias.)
- Renamed SimpleLexer.default_token to SimpleLexer.token. (+
  backwards-compatibility.)
- Refactoring of the filters: `ViStateFilter` has been deprecated. (Should not
  be used anymore.) Use the filters, as defined in prompt_toolkit.filters.
- `editing_mode` is now a property of `CommandLineInterface`. This is replacing
  the `vi_mode` parameter in `KeyBindingManager`.
- The default accept_action for the default Buffer in Application now becomes
  IGNORE. This is a much more sensible default. Pass RETURN_DOCUMENT to get
  the previous behaviour,
- Always expect an EventLoop instance in CommandLineInterface. Creating it in
  __init__ caused a memory leak.


0.60: 2016-03-14
----------------

Fixes:
- Fix in Document.paste. (The screen was not updated after an undo of a paste.)
- Don't use deprecated inspect.getargspec on Python 3.
- Fixed reading input on Windows when input was piped in stdin.
- Use correct file descriptors for input/output in run_system_command.
- Always correctly split prompt in shortcuts.prompt. (Even when multiline=False)
- Correctly align right prompt to the top when the left prompt consists of
  multiple lines.
- Correctly use Token.Transparent as default token for a TokenListControl.
- Fix in syntax synchronisation. (Better handle the case when no
  synchronisation point was found.)
- Send SIGTSTP to the whole process group.
- Correctly raise on_buffer_changed on all text changes.
- Fix in regular_languages.GrammarLexer. (Fixes bug in ptipython syntax
  highlighting.)

New features:
- Add support for additional readers to the Win32 event loop.
- Added on_render event.
- Carry the weight in layout dimensions to allow stretching.


0.59: 2016-02-27
----------------

Fixes:
- Set correct default color on Windows. (Gray instead of high intensity gray.)
- Reverse colors on Windows when foreground/background color have not been
  specified.
- Correct handling of mouse events for FillControl.
- Take margin into account when calculating Window height. (Fixes bug in
  multiline prompt.)
- Handle division by zero in UIContent.get_height_for_text.


0.58: 2016-02-23
----------------

Fixes:
- Correctly return result for mouse handler in TokenListControl.
- Bugfix in meta-backspace key binding. (Delete all whitespace before the
  cursor, when there is only whitespace.)
- Bugfix in Vi gu, gU, g? and g~ key bindings (in selection mode).
- Correctly restore default console attributes on Windows.
- Disable bracketed paste support in ConEmu. (This was broken.)
- When an unknown exception is raised in `CommandLineInterface.run()`, don't
  forget to redraw the CLI.

New features:
- Many performance improvements and better caching. (Especially in the
  `Document` class.)
- Support for continuation tokens in `shortcuts.prompt` and
  `shortcuts.create_prompt_layout`.
- Added `shortcuts.print_tokens` function for printing colored output.
- Sound bell when nothing was deleted.
- Added escape sequences for F1-F5 keys on the Linux console.
- Improved support for the Linux console. (Switch back to 16 colors.)
- Added F13-F24 input codes for xterm.
- Created prompt_toolkit.token. A custom Token implementation, that is
  compatible with Pygments.token. (This way, Pygments becomes an optional
  dependency. For many use cases, nothing except the Token class from Pygments
  was used, so it was a bit overkill to install Pygments for only that.)
- Refactoring of prompt_toolkit.styles.
- `Float` objects got a `hide_when_covering_content` option.
- Implementation of RPROMPT, like ZSH: Added `get_rprompt_tokens` to
  `create_prompt_layout`.
- Some improvements to the default style.
- Also handle Ctrl-R and Ctrl-S in Vi mode when searching.
- Added TabsProcessor: a tool to visualise tabs instead of displaying ^I.
- Give a better error message when trying to run in git-bash.
- Support for ANSI color names in style dictionaries.

- Big refactoring of the `Window` and `UIControl` classes. This should result
  in huge performance improvements on big inputs. (While first, a document
  could have 1,000 lines; now it can have about 100,000 lines on the same system.)

  The Window and UIControl have been rewritten very much. Rather than each time
  rendering the whole user control, we now only have to render the visible part.

  Because of this, many pieces had to be rewritten:
  - UIControls work differently. They return a `UIContent` instance that
    consist of a collection of lines.
  - All processors have been rewritten. (Their API changed as well, because
    they process one line at a time.)
  - Lexers work differently. `Lexer.lex_document` should now return a function
    that returns the tokens for one line. PygmentsLexer has been optimized that
    it becomes 'lazy', and it has optional syntax synchronisation. That means,
    that the lexer doesn't have to start the lexing at the beginning of the
    document. (Which would be slow for big documents.)

Backwards-incompatible changes:
- As mentioned above, the refactoring of `Window` and `UIControl` caused many
  "internal" APIs to change. All custom `UIControl`, `Processor` and `Lexer`
  classes have to be rewritten. However, for most applications this should not
  be an issue. Especially, the `shortcuts.prompt` function is
  backwards-compatible.
- `wrap_lines` became a property of `Window` instead of `BufferControl`.


0.57: 2016-01-04
----------------

Fixes:
- Made `max_render_postpone_time` configurable. The current default was bad.
  (We should probably always draw the UI once every cycle of the event loop.)


0.56: 2016-01-03
----------------

Fixes:
- Fix in bracketed paste. It was not correctly enabled for each prompt.


0.55: 2016-01-03
----------------

New features:
- Implemented bracketed paste mode. (This allows much faster pasting, as well
  as pasting without going into paste mode. This makes sure that indentation in
  ptpython for instance is kept correctly.)
- Added support for italic output and blink. (For terminals that support it.)
- Added get_horizontal_scroll, get_vertical_scroll and always_hide_cursor
  parameters to Window.
- Refactoring of the posix event loop. Better scheduling of all tasks/FDs to
  avoid starvation. (Everything should feel more responsive in high CPU
  situations.)
- Added get_default_char function to TokenListControl.
- AppendAutoSuggestion now accepts a token parameter.
- Support for ansi color names in styles.
- Accept get_width/get_height parameters in Float.
- Added Output.write_raw and accept 'raw' parameter in
  CommandLineInterface.stdout_proxy.
- Better caching of tokens in TokenListControl.
- Add mouse support to TokenListControl.
- Display "Window too small" when the window becomes too small.
- Added 'bell' function to Output.
- Accept weights in HSplit/VSplit.
- Added Registry.remove_binding method to dynamically remove key bindings.
- Added focus_on_click parameter to BufferControl.
- Introduced BufferMapping class as a wrapper around the buffers dictionary.
  This one also contains the focus stack.
- Improved 'v' and 'V' key bindings. Allow switching between line and character
  selection modes.
- Added layout.highlighters. A new, much faster way to do selection and search
  highlighting.
- Make search_state dynamic for key bindings.
- Added 'sentence' option to WordCompleter.
- Cache Document.lines for better performance.
- Implementation of BLOCK selections. (Cut, copy, paste.)
- Accept a 'reserve_space_for_menu' parameter in the shortcuts. (This is an
  integer.)
- Support for 24bit true color on vt100 terminals.
- Added CommandLineInterface.on_invalidate event.
- Added __version__ to __init__.py.

Fixes:
- Always show cursor in the 'done' state.
- Allow HSplit to have zero children.
- Bugfix for handling of backslash on Windows with some non-us keyboards.
  (Ptpython issue #28.)
- Never render characters outside the visible screen region.
- Fix in WordCompleter. When case insensitive and input contained uppercase.
- Highlight search match when the cursor is at any position on the match. (not
  just the beginning.)

Backwards-incompatible changes:
(Most changes will probably not have an impact on external applications.)
- Change in the `Style` API. This allows caching of Attrs in renderer and
  faster rendering.  (Style now has a get_attrs_for_token instead of a
  get_token_to_attributes_dict method.)
- Removed DefaultStyle. Created PygmentsStyle.from_defaults class method instead.
- Removed AbortAction.IGNORE. This was ambiguous.
- Accept 'cli' parameter in 'walk' and 'find_window_for_buffer_name'.
- The focus stack is now stored in BufferMapping.
- ViStateFilter and KeyBindingManager now accept a get_vi_state callable
  instead of vi_state itself. (This way a key bindings registry becomes
  stateless.)
- HighlightSearchProcessor and HighlightSelectionProcessor became deprecated.
  (Use highlighters instead.)


0.54: 2015-10-29
----------------

New features:
- Allow CommandLineInterface to run in any thread.
- Hide cursor while rendering.
- Added add_reader/remove_reader methods to EventLoop.
- Support for 'reverse' style.
- Redraw more lazy, by using invalidate.
- Added show_cursor property to Screen.
- Center or right align text in TokenListControl also when it spans multiple
  lines.

Fixes:
- Bugfix in PathCompleter. (Expanduser issue.)
- Fix in signal handler.
- Use utf-8 encoding in Vt100_Output by default.
- Use correct default token in BufferControl.
- Fix in ControlL key binding. Use @handle to allow desactivation.

Backwards-incompatible changes:
- Renamed create_default_layout to create_prompt_layout
- Renamed create_default_application to create_prompt_application
- Renamed Layout to Container.
- Renamed CommandLineInterfaces.request_redraw to invalidate.
- Changed the actual value of SEARCH_BUFFER, DEFAULT_BUFFER, SYSTEM_BUFFER and
  DUMMY_BUFFER.
- Changed order of keyword arguments of the BufferControl class. "buffer_name"
  now comes first.
- Removed old pt(i)python code.

0.53: 2015-10-06
----------------

New features:
- Handling of the insert key in Vi mode.
- Added 'zt' and 'zb' Vi key bindings.
- Added delete key binding for deleting selected text.
- Select word below cursor on double mouse click.
- Added `wrap_lines` option to TokenListControl.
- Added `KeyBindingManager.for_prompt`.

Fixes:
- Fix in rendering output.
- Reset renderer correctly in run_in_terminal.
- Only reset buffer when using `AbortAction.RETRY`.
- Fix in handling of exit (Ctrl-D) key presses.
- Fix in `CompleteEvent`. Correctly set `completion_requested`.

Backwards-incompatible changes:
- Renamed `ValidationError.index` to `ValidationError.cursor_position`.
- Renamed `shortcuts.get_input` to `shortcuts.prompt`.
- Return empty string instead of None in
  `Document.current_char`/`char_before_cursor`.


0.52: 2015-09-24
----------------

Fixes:
- Fix in auto suggestion: hide suggestion when accepting input.


0.51: 2015-09-24
----------------

New features:
- Mouse support. (Scrolling and clicking for vt100 terminals. For Windows only
  clicking.) Both the autocompletion menus and buffer controls respond to
  scolling and clicking.
- Added auto suggestions. (Like the fish shell.)
- Stdout proxy become thread safe.
- Linewrapping can now be disabled, instead we get horizontal scrolling.
- Line numbering can now be relative. Like the vi 'relativenumber' option.

Fixes:
- Fixed excessive scrolling in Windows.
- Bugfix in search highlighting.
- Copy all words during repetition of Ctrl-W presses.
- The 'libs' folder has been removed.
- Fix in MultiColumnCompletionsMenu: don't create very big columns.

Backwards-incompatible changes:
- Disable search by default in KeyBindingManager.
- Separated abort/exit key bindings. Disabled by default in KeyBindingManager.
- 'Ignore' became the default on_abort action in `Application`.
- 'Ignore' became the default accept_action in `Buffer`.
- The layout processors have been refactored. The API is changed.
- `SwitchableValidator` has been renamed to `ConditionalValidator`.
- `WindowRenderInfo` has several incompatible changes.
- Margins have been refactored completely. Now it's the window that has the
  margin instead of `BufferControl`. Is is both much more performant and
  flexible.


0.50: 2015-09-06
----------------

Fix:
- Leaving of alternate screen on Windows.


0.49: 2015-09-06
----------------

New features:
- Added MANIFEST.in
- Better support for multiline prompts in shortcuts.
- Added Document.set_document method.
- Added 'default' argument to `shortcuts.create_default_application`.
- Added `align_center` option for `TokenListControl`.
- Added optional key bindings for full page navigation. (Moved key bindings
  from pyvim into prompt-toolkit.)
- Accepts default_char in BufferControl for filling the background.
- Added InFocusStack filter.

Fixes:
- Small fix in TokenListControl: use the right Char for aligning.

Backwards-incompatible changes:
- Removed deprecated 'tokens' attribute from GrammarLexer.


0.48: 2015-09-02
----------------

New features:
- run_in_terminal now returns the result of the called function.
- Made history attribute of Buffer class public.
- Added support for sub CommandLineInterfaces.
- Accept optional vi_state parameter in KeyBindingManager.

Fixes:
- Pop-up menu positioning. The menu was shown too often above instead of below
  the cursor.
- Fix in Control-W key binding. When there is only whitespace before the
  cursor, delete the whitespace.
- Rendering bug fix in open_in_editor: run editor using cli.run_in_terminal.
- Fix in renderer. Correctly reserve the vertical space as required by the
  layout.
- Small fix in Margin ABC.
- Added __iter__ to History ABC.
- Small bugfix in CommandLineInterface: create correct eventloop when no
  eventloop was given.
- Never schedule a second repaint operation when a previous was not yet
  executed.


0.47: 2015-08-19
----------------

New features:
- Added `prompt_toolkit.layout.utils.iter_token_lines`.
- Allow `None` values on the focus stack.
- Buffers can be readonly. Added `IsReadOnly` filter.
- `eager` behaviour for key bindings. When a key binding is eager it will be
  executed as soon as it's matched, even when there is another binding that
  starts with this key sequence.
- Custom margins for BufferControl.

Fixes:
- Don't trigger autocompletion on paste.
- Added `pre_run` parameter to CommandLineInterface.
- Correct invalidation of BeforeInput and AfterInput.
- Correctly handle transparancy. (For floats.)
- Small change in the algorithm to determine Window dimensions: keep in the
  bounds of the Window dimensions.

Backwards-incompatible changes:
- There a now a `Lexer` abstract base class. Every lexer should be an instance
  of that class, and Pygments lexers should be wrapped in a `PygmentsLexer`
  class. `prompt_toolkit.shortcuts` still accepts Pygments lexers directly for
  backwards-compatibilty.
- BufferControl no longer has a `show_line_numbers` argument. Pass a
  `NumberredMargin` instance instead.
- The `History` class became an abstract base class and only defines an
  interface. The default history class is now called `InMemoryHistory`.


0.46: 2015-08-08
----------------

New features:
- By default, in shortcuts, only show search highlighting when the search is
  the current input buffer.
- Accept 'count' for all search operations. (For repetition.)
- `shortcuts.create_default_layout` accepts a `multiline` parameter.
- Show meta display text for completions also in multi-column mode.

Fixes:
- Correct invalidation of DefaultPrompt when search direction changes.
- Correctly include/exclude current cursor position in search.
- More consistency in styles.
- Fix in ConditionalProcessor.has_focus.
- Python 2.6 compatibility fix.
- Show cursor at the correct position during reverse-i-search.
- Fixed stdout encoding bug for vt100 output.

Backwards-incompatible changes:
- Use of `ConditionalContainer` everywhere. The `Window` class no longer
  accepts a `filter` argument to decide about the visibility. Instead
  wrapping inside a `ConditionalContainer` class is required.


0.45: 2015-07-30
----------------

Fixes:
- Bug fix on OS X: correctly detect platform as not Windows.


0.44: 2015-07-30
