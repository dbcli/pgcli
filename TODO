* [ ] Fix: SELECT id, <tab>  FROM django_migrations; - Auto-completion for the second column name is broken. Find the last keyword and use it for completion.
* [ ] Bottom status bar is cut-off in half pane. Figure out how to fix that.
* [ ] Fix: Autocompletion won't go away after semi-colons. This an artifact of stripping special chars in the partially typed words. Need to selectively remove parens.
* [ ] Default host should not be set to localhost. Since it causes problems in IPv6 machines. Need to research this one further.
* [ ] Column completion for nested sql.
* [ ] Add JOIN to the list of keywords and provide proper autocompletion for it. 
* [ ] Improve the smart completion for Insert statement. (Needs table specific columns)
* [ ] Add a few more special commands. (\l pattern, \di, \dp, \ds, \dv, \dy, \z etc)
* [ ] Write a doc about how to add new pgspecial commands.(psql -E)
* [ ] Improve the smart completion for Update statement. (Needs table specific columns)
* [ ] Improve the SELECT <> completion when a FROM clause is already present. (Send the whole text to sqlparse to find the table name and do column suggestions based on that.)
* [ ] Show/hide docs for a statement using a keybinding.
* [ ] Cmd-K breaks in OS X iterm. - This might be a prompt_toolkit bug.
* [ ] Check why Indexes have a invalid at the end when \d is called on them.
* [ ] Add some tests. Sanity, Unit, Completion, Config.
* [ ] Add tests for smart completion.
* [ ] Check how to add the name of the table before printing the table.

* [ ] Add logging.
* [ ] Setup the pgcli.com website.
* [ ] Add a new trigger for M-/ that does dumb completion.

* [ ] Refactor the execution and output into a separate class.
* [ ] Create a class for the config and make it easy to access.
* [ ] Set multi-line via config file.
* [ ] New Feature List - Write the current version to config file. At launch if the version has changed, display the changelog between the two versions.
* [o] Separate the column completions to be table specific. (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE)
* [X] Write a doc about how to run it in develop mode. (pip install -e .)
