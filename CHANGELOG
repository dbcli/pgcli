CHANGELOG
=========

0.51: 2015-09-24
----------------

New features:
- Mouse support. (Scrolling and clicking for vt100 terminals. For Windows only
  clicking.) Both the autocompletion menus and buffer controls respond to
  scolling and clicking.
- Added auto suggestions. (Like the fish shell.)
- Stdout proxy become thread safe.
- Linewrapping can now be disabled, instead we get horizontal scrolling.
- Line numbering can now be relative. Like the vi 'relativenumber' option.

Fixes:
- Fixed excessive scrolling in Windows.
- Bugfix in search highlighting.
- Copy all words during repetition of Ctrl-W presses.
- The 'libs' folder has been removed.
- Fix in MultiColumnCompletionsMenu: don't create very big columns.

Backwards-incompatible changes:
- Disable search by default in KeyBindingManager.
- Separated abort/exit key bindings. Disabled by default in KeyBindingManager.
- 'Ignore' became the default on_abort action in `Application`.
- 'Ignore' became the default accept_action in `Buffer`.
- The layout processors have been refactored. The API is changed.
- `SwitchableValidator` has been renamed to `ConditionalValidator`.
- `WindowRenderInfo` has several incompatible changes.
- Margins have been refactored completely. Now it's the window that has the
  margin instead of `BufferControl`. Is is both much more performant and
  flexible.


0.50: 2015-09-06
----------------

Fix:
- Leaving of alternate screen on Windows.


0.49: 2015-09-06
----------------

New features:
- Added MANIFEST.in
- Better support for multiline prompts in shortcuts.
- Added Document.set_document method.
- Added 'default' argument to `shortcuts.create_default_application`.
- Added `align_center` option for `TokenListControl`.
- Added optional key bindings for full page navigation. (Moved key bindings
  from pyvim into prompt-toolkit.)
- Accepts default_char in BufferControl for filling the background.
- Added InFocusStack filter.

Fixes:
- Small fix in TokenListControl: use the right Char for aligning.

Backwards-incompatible changes:
- Removed deprecated 'tokens' attribute from GrammarLexer.


0.48: 2015-09-02
----------------

New features:
- run_in_terminal now returns the result of the called function.
- Made history attribute of Buffer class public.
- Added support for sub CommandLineInterfaces.
- Accept optional vi_state parameter in KeyBindingManager.

Fixes:
- Pop-up menu positioning. The menu was shown too often above instead of below
  the cursor.
- Fix in Control-W key binding. When there is only whitespace before the
  cursor, delete the whitespace.
- Rendering bug fix in open_in_editor: run editor using cli.run_in_terminal.
- Fix in renderer. Correctly reserve the vertical space as required by the
  layout.
- Small fix in Margin ABC.
- Added __iter__ to History ABC.
- Small bugfix in CommandLineInterface: create correct eventloop when no
  eventloop was given.
- Never schedule a second repaint operation when a previous was not yet
  executed.


0.47: 2015-08-19
----------------

New features:
- Added `prompt_toolkit.layout.utils.iter_token_lines`.
- Allow `None` values on the focus stack.
- Buffers can be readonly. Added `IsReadOnly` filter.
- `eager` behaviour for key bindings. When a key binding is eager it will be
  executed as soon as it's matched, even when there is another binding that
  starts with this key sequence.
- Custom margins for BufferControl.

Fixes:
- Don't trigger autocompletion on paste.
- Added `pre_run` parameter to CommandLineInterface.
- Correct invalidation of BeforeInput and AfterInput.
- Correctly handle transparancy. (For floats.)
- Small change in the algorithm to determine Window dimensions: keep in the
  bounds of the Window dimensions.

Backwards-incompatible changes:
- There a now a `Lexer` abstract base class. Every lexer should be an instance
  of that class, and Pygments lexers should be wrapped in a `PygmentsLexer`
  class. `prompt_toolkit.shortcuts` still accepts Pygments lexers directly for
  backwards-compatibilty.
- BufferControl no longer has a `show_line_numbers` argument. Pass a
  `NumberredMargin` instance instead.
- The `History` class became an abstract base class and only defines an
  interface. The default history class is now called `InMemoryHistory`.


0.46: 2015-08-08
----------------

New features:
- By default, in shortcuts, only show search highlighting when the search is
  the current input buffer.
- Accept 'count' for all search operations. (For repetition.)
- `shortcuts.create_default_layout` accepts a `multiline` parameter.
- Show meta display text for completions also in multi-column mode.

Fixes:
- Correct invalidation of DefaultPrompt when search direction changes.
- Correctly include/exclude current cursor position in search.
- More consistency in styles.
- Fix in ConditionalProcessor.has_focus.
- Python 2.6 compatibility fix.
- Show cursor at the correct position during reverse-i-search.
- Fixed stdout encoding bug for vt100 output.

Backwards-incompatible changes:
- Use of `ConditionalContainer` everywhere. The `Window` class no longer
  accepts a `filter` argument to decide about the visibility. Instead
  wrapping inside a `ConditionalContainer` class is required.


0.45: 2015-07-30
----------------

Fixes:
- Bug fix on OS X: correctly detect platform as not Windows.


0.44: 2015-07-30
