======

Features:
---------
* Perform auto-completion refresh in background. (Thanks: Amjith, `Darik Gamble`_, `Irina Truong`_).
  When the auto-completion entries are refreshed, the update now happens in a
  background thread. This means large databases with thousands of tables are

0.19.1
======

BugFixes:

0.19.0
======

Features:
---------

* Wider completion menus can be enabled via the config file. (Thanks: `Jonathan Slenders`_)

  Open the config file (~/.pgclirc) and check if you have
  ``wider_completion_menu`` option available. If not add it in and set it to
  ``True``.

0.18.0
======

Features:
---------

* Add fuzzy matching for the table names and column names.

  Matching very long table/column names are now easier with fuzzy matching. The
  fuzzy match works like the fuzzy open in SublimeText or Vim's Ctrl-P plugin.

  eg: Typing ``djmv`` will match `django_migration_views` since it is able to
  match parts of the input to the full table name.

* Change the timing information to seconds.

  The ``Command Time`` and ``Format Time`` are now displayed in seconds instead
  of a unitless number displayed in scientific notation.

* Support for named queries (favorite queries). (Thanks: `Brett Atoms`_)

  Frequently typed queries can now be saved and recalled using a name using
  newly added special commands (``\n[+]``, ``\ns``, ``\nd``).

  eg:

::

    # Save a query
    pgcli> \ns simple select * from foo
    saved

    # List all saved queries
    pgcli> \n+

    # Execute a saved query
    pgcli> \n simple

    # Delete a saved query
    pgcli> \nd simple

* Pasting queries into the pgcli repl is orders of magnitude faster. (Thanks: `Jonathan Slenders`_)

* Add support for PGPASSWORD environment variable to pass the password for the
  postgres database. (Thanks: `Irina Truong`_)

  ``\refresh``. This is useful if the database was updated by an external means
  and you'd like to refresh the auto-completions to pick up the new change.

Bug Fixes:
----------

* Fix an error when running ``\d table_name`` when running on a table with rules. (Thanks: `Ali Kargın`_)

* Add support for building RPM and DEB packages. (Thanks: dp_)
* Add subsequence matching for completion. (Thanks: `Daniel Rocco`_)

  partially typed word. Now completions will match even if the partially typed
  word is in the middle of a suggestion.
  eg: When you type 'mig', 'django_migrations' will be suggested.
* Completion for built-in tables and temporary tables are suggested after entering a prefix of ``pg_``. (Thanks: `Darik Gamble`_)
* Add place holder doc strings for special commands that are planned for implementation. (Thanks: `Irina Truong`_)

* Add special command ``\dT`` to show datatypes. (Thanks: `Darik Gamble`_)
* Add auto-completion support for datatypes in CREATE, SELECT etc. (Thanks: `Darik Gamble`_)
* Improve the auto-completion in WHERE clause with logical operators. (Thanks: `Darik Gamble`_)
*

Bug Fixes:
